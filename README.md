# maven-archetypes
A collection of Maven archetypes built by myself.

## How to use
Download the projects and run a mvn install. Afterwards, you may either copy the archetype-catalog.xml inside your local repository, run a mvn archetype:crawl to discover the archetypes you just installed or give the path to the catalog directly when running the generation command.
