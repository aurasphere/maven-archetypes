# maven-archetypes
A collection of Maven archetypes built by myself.

## How to use
Download the projects and run a mvn install. Afterwards, you may either copy the archetype-catalog.xml inside your local repository, run a mvn archetype:crawl to discover the archetypes you just installed or give the path to the catalog directly when running the generation command.

**NOTE: this project proved to be not so useful (apart from maybe the Maven library archetype). The usage is somewhat discouraged for them being too much opinionated and becoming too quickly obsolete (especially the ones with many dependencies)*
